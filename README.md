# Subtheme-Sentiment-Analysis-
The projectâ€™s goal is to develop a system that can automatically process text data, extract key topics (subthemes), and analyze sentiments. This will enable a deeper understanding of textual content, such as customer feedback, by identifying the main points and emotions expressed, leading to more informed decision-making and strategy development.
# Explanation and Motivation
# Approach:

The approach involves cleaning the text data, tokenizing it, and using simple keyword matching for subtheme extraction. Sentiment analysis is done using VADER, a pre-trained sentiment analyzer.
This method is straightforward and allows for easy interpretation and debugging. It leverages existing NLP tools and models to quickly prototype a solution.
# Improvements:

Use more sophisticated NLP models like BERT or GPT for better context understanding.
Train a custom classifier for both subtheme extraction and sentiment analysis using labeled data.
Implement dependency parsing to capture the relationships between words and improve the accuracy of subtheme and sentiment extraction.
# Possible Problems:

Keyword matching might miss synonyms or context-specific phrases.
Pre-trained sentiment analyzers may not perform well on domain-specific text without fine-tuning.
Handling negations and complex sentence structures can be challenging.
