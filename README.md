# Subtheme-Sentiment-Analysis-
The projectâ€™s goal is to develop a system that can automatically process text data, extract key topics (subthemes), and analyze sentiments. This will enable a deeper understanding of textual content, such as customer feedback, by identifying the main points and emotions expressed, leading to more informed decision-making and strategy development.
